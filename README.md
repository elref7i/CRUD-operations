# Product Management System (CRUD Operation)

This project is a simple **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operation** built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, and **LocalStorage** to store product data.

## Project Overview

The Product Management System allows users to perform basic CRUD operations on a set of products. Users can:
- Add a new product by entering details such as product name, category, price, description, and uploading an image.
- View all added products.
- Update the details of an existing product.
- Delete a product from the system.
- Search for products by name.

All product data is stored locally using the browser’s **LocalStorage**, ensuring that data persists even after the page is refreshed.

## Features

1. **Add New Product**:
   - Input fields for product name, category (from a predefined list), price, and description.
   - Option to upload a product image.
   
2. **Update Product**:
   - Edit the details of an existing product and save the changes.

3. **Delete Product**:
   - Remove a product from the system.

4. **Search Functionality**:
   - Search for products by name to quickly find specific entries.

5. **LocalStorage**:
   - All product data is stored in the browser’s **LocalStorage**, allowing for data persistence without a backend.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: To handle the CRUD operations and manage the interactions on the client side.
- **LocalStorage**: To save and retrieve product data.
